<h1 style="text-align:center;">ShimmerRecyclerView</h1>
<p>ShimmerRecyclerView is an custom RecyclerView library based on Facebook's
    "Shimmer":https://github.com/facebook/shimmer-android effect for Android library and inspired from "Sharish's
    ShimmerRecyclerView":https://github.com/sharish/ShimmerRecyclerView.</p>
<p>There is reason behind creating a separate library for ShimmerRecyclerView, most of libraries doesn't not support
    runtime switching of `LayoutManager` or shimmer `layout` resources. Secondly the other similar library is build upon
    "Supercharge's ShimmerLayout":https://github.com/team-supercharge/ShimmerLayout which is I feel very less active in
    terms of release. So I came up with an alternative.</p>
<h2>Download</h2>

<p>The following snippet shows how you can use Shimmer RecyclerView in your project.</p>
<h4>Layout</h4><!--- This comment should appear as it is in HTML -->
<pre><code>&lt;com.todkars.shimmer.ShimmerRecyclerView
    android:id="@+id/shimmer_recycler_view"
    android:layout_width="match_parent"
    android:layout_height="wrap_content"
    app:shimmer_recycler_colored="true"
    app:shimmer_recycler_duration="1000" /&gt;
</code></pre>
<h4>Activity</h4>
<pre><code>public class MainActivity extends Activity {

    private ShimmerRecyclerView mShimmerRecyclerView;

    //... other variables

    @Override
    public void onCreate(Bundle savedInstanceState) {
        super.onCreate(savedInstanceState);

        mShimmerRecyclerView = findViewById(R.id.shimmer_recycler_view);
        mShimmerRecyclerView.setLayoutManager(new LinearLayoutManager(this));
        mShimmerRecyclerView.setAdapter(adapter);

        // This is optional, use if no attributes are mentioned in layout xml resource.
        // WARNING: Setting Shimmer programmatically will obsolete all xml attributes.
        /* mShimmerRecyclerView.setShimmer(mShimmer); */

        mShimmerRecyclerView.showShimmer();     // to start showing shimmer

        // To stimulate long running work using android.os.Handler
        mHandler.postDelayed((Runnable) () -&gt; {
            mShimmerRecyclerView.hideShimmer(); // to hide shimmer
        }, 3000);
    }
}
